This project was made as a fulfilment for the requirements of the ICT Upskilling Programme in the Frontend Web Development Track at Alhussein Technical University (HTU).

The website shows different startups in the Jordanian ecosystem. Each startup can be a part of different sectors.

The home page shows a welcome statement, a chart made with chart.js library, and the startup organized to follow their sectors.

The logged in user can submit requests to add new startups to the system.

The admin can do the following:
- Create new startups
